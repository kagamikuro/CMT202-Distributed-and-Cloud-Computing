Outline Description of Module:
The aim of this module is to familiarize students with issues and successful approaches in the design and implementation of distributed systems. Detailed case studies of widely used systems will be discussed in this module.
The course covers: the organisation of distributed systems, focusing on various architectural styles used to develop such systems; core technologies to implement distributed systems; various models and infrastructures to support Cloud computing â€“ such as virtualisation; and emerging themes in distributed systems, such as fault tolerance and policy driven autonomic self-management. 

 

On completion of the module a student should be able to:
1. Demonstrate and apply knowledge about the state-of-the-art in distributed-systems architectures.
2. Understand issues in distributing an application across a network.
3. Appreciate the difference between various distributed computing middleware and their communication mechanisms.
4. Demonstrate and apply knowledge of common security practices within distributed systems.
5. Understand and be able to utilize Cloud computing environments.
6. Demonstrate and apply knowledge of standards in distributed computing, and the impact of standardisation on application programs.

 

 

How the module will be delivered:
This module will be delivered through a combination of lectures, supervised lab sessions, example classes and tutorials, as appropriate.

 

Skills that will be practised and developed:
A. Design a distributed systems architecture using middleware where appropriate.
B. Compare different designs and assess them using appropriate metrics.
C. Design and use services in a distributed environment.
D. Specify the deployment of Cloud computing applications.
E. Design wrappers and services which overcome heterogeneity and support interoperability of autonomous information resources.

How the module will be assessed:
Coursework:  the coursework will allow students to demonstrate their knowledge and practical skills and to apply the principles taught in lectures.
Exam: a written exam (2 h) will test the students' knowledge and understanding as elaborated under the learning outcomes.

Students will be provided with reassessment opportunities in line with University regulations.
